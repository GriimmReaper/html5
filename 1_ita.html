                        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are browned and tender, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the chopped rosemary.</li>
                        <li>Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring, until it is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
                        <li>Begin adding the warm vegetable broth to the rice, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked through, about 18-20 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Serve the risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
