                        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is golden and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
                        <li>Add the red pepper flakes to the skillet and cook for an additional 30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet and toss to coat the pasta with the garlic and oil. If the pasta seems dry, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
                        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the chopped parsley. Season with salt to taste.</li>
