                        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>

                        <li>Using a ring mold or a metal cookie cutter, place it in the skillet and spoon the batter into the mold, filling it about halfway. Cover with a lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the pancakes are cooked through.</li>
                        <li>Remove the ring mold and serve the pancakes warm, dusted with powdered sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup. Garnish with fresh berries if desired.</li>
